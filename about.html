      <h2>Thrill of the Grill</h2>
      <p>
        I have no prior cooking experience, except for my love to do it and 20+
        years of cooking for my kids (Shoutout Alex and Josh!). I have always
        photographed the delicious food I cook, but had no way to share it. If
        I'm being honest, my phone background has been a picture of a rack of
        ribs for way too long. However, after an enlighenting conversation with
        my son about why I'm "too old to be Instagram," the Thrill of the Grill
        was born!
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always had a passion for grilling, and over years of practice I
        have perfected my technique and execution. With my two smokers, a gas
        barbeque, and hand-crafted Argentinian wood-fired Parilla, I can cook
        damn near anything to perfection (which is medium-rare in most cases).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, my food is just too good not to share! I love cooking for
        friends and family, and everyone is invited to a Green House bbq.
