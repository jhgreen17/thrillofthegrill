        <h2>Thrill of the Grill</h2>
        <p>
          I have no prior cooking experience, except for my love to do it and
          20+ years of cooking for my kids (Shoutout Alex and Josh!). I have
          always photographed the delicious food I cook, but had no way to share
          it. If I'm being honest, my phone background has been a picture of a
          rack of ribs for way too long. However, after an enlighenting
          conversation with my son about why I'm "too old to be Instagram," the
          Thrill of the Grill was born!
        </p>
        <p>
          I've always had a passion for grilling, and over years of practice I
          have perfected my technique and execution. With my two smokers, a gas
          barbeque, and hand-crafted Argentinian wood-fired Parilla, I can cook
          damn near anything to perfection (which is medium-rare in most cases).
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, my food is just too good not to share! I love cooking for
          friends and family, and everyone is invited to a Green House bbq.
